      Step 1 Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).Step 2
      Season chicken on all sides with salt and ground black pepper.Step 3
      Heat olive oil over medium-high heat in an ovenproof skillet. Place chicken skin-side down in skillet and cook until browned, about 5 minutes.Step 4 Turn chicken over; stir mushrooms with a pinch of salt into skillet. Increase heat to high; cook, stirring mushrooms occasionally, until mushrooms shrink slightly, about 5 minutes.Step 5 Transfer skillet to the preheated oven and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken breasts to a plate and loosely tent with foil; set aside.Step 6
      Set skillet on the stovetop over medium-high heat; cook and stir mushrooms until brown bits start to form on the bottom of the pan, about 5 minutes. Pour water into the skillet, and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits off of the bottom of the pan. Cook until water is reduced by half, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.Step 7
      Stir in any accumulated juices from the chicken into the skillet. Stir butter into mushroom mixture, stirring constantly until butter is completely melted and incorporated.Step 8 Season with salt and pepper. Spoon mushroom sauce over chicken and serve.There’s a big difference between juicy chicken breasts and rubbery chicken breasts. Obviously, you want to avoid the latter at all costs. Follow these 4 steps and you’re gold. You want to add protein to favorites like Caesar salad or fix up a quick chicken salad or club sandwich? Try this method and savor the results.Want to cook up some healthier chicken tenders for the kids (or, um, for yourself)? We’ve got you covered. Or, if you wanna make a boring old rubbery chicken breast, that’s fine, go ahead and keep slapping that bird into the pan without the little tips we give you here. But chew (and chew) on this: We’re biting into juicy, delicious chicken every time. <a href="#section1">Back to Top</a>
